1. Personal Information We Process
We may collect a variety of Personal Information from or about you or your devices from various sources, as described below. Where required by applicable law, we indicate whether and why you must provide us with your Personal Information, as well as the consequences of failing to do so.

A. Personal Information You Provide to Us

When you register for or use the Platform, we may collect Personal Information about you and we may link this Personal Information with other Personal Information about you. You may provide us with Personal Information in various ways on the Platform:

Registration and Account Information. If you sign up for a Platform account, we will ask you to provide your email address and birth date, and allow you to create a username and password. In the future, we may ask that you provide additional information that we will associate with your account in order to protect the security of your account, enable certain account features, or ensure VRChat complies with legal requirements.

Payment and Billing Information. If you choose to: (i) access or use parts of the Platform that require payments or fees, (ii) purchase a subscription that provides you access to extra features on the Platform, or (iii) become a Seller and request payout for VRChat Credits, you may be required to provide Personal Information to third parties such as gaming platforms (e.g., Steam and Meta) and VRC Creator Economy partners (e.g., Tilia). Those third parties may send your Personal Information to payment processors who will process transactions on our behalf and to VRChat so we can verify your payment and provide you with any applicable features or benefits. We may also collect and retain Personal Information relating to the transactions you conduct on the Platform, such as purchasing for Seller Content or paid-only roles within groups using VRChat Credits.

User Communications. If you contact us directly, we may collect additional information about you. For example, if you contact us with an inquiry or to receive customer support, we will ask that you provide your name and email address. We will also collect the contents of the message you send and other information you choose to provide.

Uploaded Images. Certain Platform features may allow you to upload images for use in your profile or the Platform. If you utilize these features, you should not upload pictures that can be used to identify you or any other person.

Informational Emails, Marketing, and Newsletters. If you sign up to receive informational or marketing email from us, then we will collect Personal Information from you, such as your first and last name, email address, and your areas of interest. When we send you emails, we may track whether you open them to learn how to deliver a better customer experience and improve the Platform.

Job Application Materials. If you apply for a job with us directly, you may provide us with your resume, full name, and contact details (including your mailing address, email address, and phone number), and any other information that you choose to provide to us. If you apply for a job with us through a third-party platform (such as LinkedIn or Lever), we will collect the information you make available to us through such a third-party platform.

B. Personal Information We Collect When You Use the Platform 

Usage Information. We may collect or infer Personal Information about you based on how you use and interact with the Platform. For example, we may create a profile associated with your account that will allow us to apply your previously expressed preferences and settings to any “world” or “instance” that you join.

In-Platform Communications. When using the Platform, including participation in different “worlds” or “instances,” you may disclose Personal Information to us and to other users of the Platform. This may occur when you engage in conversations using your microphone (if enabled), text chats, and other user-to-user interactions.

Movement Information. When accessing the Platform through a VR Client, we may collect information about the physical movements of your fingers, hands, head, and other parts of your body depending on the equipment that you use. Please note that we will only receive Movement Information from devices or services that you choose to use or enable in conjunction with the Platform.

Eye Movement Information. If the eye tracking feature is enabled, we may collect information about the location and movement of your eyes. For clarity, we only receive data about the relative position and movement of your eyes from your headset or other hardware; we do not collect or scan your retinas or eyes to gather this information.

C. Information Collected via Automated Means  

Location Information. We may use your IP address to obtain general information about the physical location from which you are connecting to the Internet. We do not collect any precise geolocation data from your devices or otherwise. 

Cookies and Similar Technologies. We utilize cookies and other tracking technologies in conjunction with the Platform. For details about the types of tracking technologies we use, why we use them, and certain choices available to you related to these technologies, please see our Cookie Policy.

D. Personal Information We Receive from Third Parties

Our Partners. We may receive Personal Information about you from third parties such as analytics services, vendors providing additional information on your IP address (for example, approximate location), gaming infrastructure and platform providers, social networks, and advertisers. Such additional information includes additional IP address information, information about your device, and connected social media account details. We may combine this information with other Personal Information we have about you. 

Social Media. We use Sprout Social's social media management tool to manage and process our social media accounts (e.g., Facebook, Instagram). Sprout Social compiles posts and messages relevant to VRChat from many social media channels we use clearly and effectively for analysis and processing. More information about Sprout Social’s privacy practices is available here: https://sproutsocial.com/privacy-policy/.

Fraud Prevention & Anti-Cheat Information. We aim to provide users with a positive user experience on the Platform by minimizing abuse of VRChat or other users on the Platform. We strictly enforce prohibitions against cheating, hacking, account stealing and any other unauthorized or fraudulent activity on the Platform. We use a variety of anti-cheat and fraud prevention technologies to help us identify and prevent malicious activity. These services may collect and analyze data about your device and the software on your computer to detect cheating and misuse of the Platform. For example, these services may monitor your gameplay and device’s RAM, processes, communications, and file storage and otherwise detect the use of “modified clients.” One such service we use is Easy Anti-Cheat from Epic Games, Inc.

2. How We Use the Personal Information We Collect
We collect, use, and disclose Personal Information for the following purposes: 

Providing you access to the Platform. We may use your Personal Information to operate and provide you access to the Platform and its features.

Securing and protecting the Platform. We may use your Personal Information to identify and prevent fraud, abuse, and cheating on the Platform, to secure the Platform, and to respond to trust and safety issues that may arise.

If you submit a user support ticket, we may utilize artificial intelligence to ensure it is categorized and responded to appropriately. With your consent, we may also communicate with you for marketing purposes.

Evaluating your job application. We may use Personal Information you voluntarily provide to process your job application.

Facilitating purchases and payouts. If you pay for access to certain features or purchase VRChat Credits we may use your Personal Information to provide you with access to them. If you purchase a subscription, we may process your Personal Information for as long as you maintain that subscription. Additionally, if you request approval to become a Seller in the VRC Creator Economy or request payout for Earned Credits, we may use your personal information to decide whether to grant your request.

Facilitating Promotions. We may use your Personal Information to facilitate contests, sweepstakes, and other promotions in which you choose to participate. 

Meeting our legal obligations.

Other purposes. We may also use Personal Information for other purposes for which we provide specific notice at the time the Personal Information is collected. 

More details about our uses of specific categories of Personal Information are available in our U.S. State Data Privacy Disclosure. 

3. When We Disclose Information
We may disclose Personal Information to third parties in the following circumstances: 

Vendors and Service Providers. We work with third-party service providers who provide Platform security, website development, application development, hosting, payment, maintenance, marketing, advertising, and other services in connection with the Platform. We allow some of these third parties to access and process your Personal Information if doing so is necessary for them to provide us (or you) with their services.. 

Analytics Services. We allow analytics services to access Personal Information to help us understand how the Platform is used and user preferences. 

Other Users. You may choose to disclose Personal Information to other users of the Platform via conversations, chats, engaging in VRChat Credit transactions, or other user-to-user interactions. Additionally, we may disclose your username to other users if we are investigating a violation of the TOS or applicable law, or if it is reasonably necessary to do so to resolve a dispute.

As Required by Law and Similar Disclosures. We may disclose Personal Information about you if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with any applicable laws, in response to a court order, judicial or other government subpoena or warrant, or to otherwise cooperate with law enforcement or other governmental agencies. 

To Enforce Legal Claims. We reserve the right to disclose Personal Information about you that we believe, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to (i) take precautions against liability, (ii) protect ourselves or others from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses or activity, (iii) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations, (iv) protect the security or integrity of the Platform and any facilities or equipment used to make the Platform available, or (v) protect our property or other legal rights (including, but not limited to, enforcement of our agreements), or the rights, property, or safety of others. 

Merger, Sale, or Other Asset Transfers. Personal Information may be disclosed and otherwise transferred to an acquirer, successor, or assignee as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing, sale of assets, or similar transaction, or in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership in which Personal Information is transferred to one or more third parties as one of our business assets. Where required by applicable law, you will be informed of such disclosure and we will obtain your consent. 

Aggregate and De-Identified Data. We may make certain aggregate or otherwise de-identified information available to third parties for various purposes, including compliance with various reporting obligations, unless we are prohibited from doing so under applicable law. 

At Your Direction. We may disclose information (including Personal Information, Movement Information, or Eye Movement Information) to third parties if you expressly direct or authorize us to do so. For example, if you enable the Open Sound Control protocol (“OSC”) in the Platform and use it to connect to third-party devices or services, you are directing us to share your Movement Information or other information (which may include Personal Information) to those third-party devices and services. Please note that if you direct us to share information with a third party, via OSC or otherwise, that does not have a Service Provider relationship with VRChat, we will not have control over how that third party processes or shares your information. Your information will be governed by that third party’s privacy policy, which you should review before directing us to share information with such third party. 

4. Facial Tracking
Certain Platform features use video and camera input of your facial movements and translates that input to animate the facial features of your avatar. 

Please review the following carefully. By enabling features that utilize facial tracking, you agree to the terms in this Section. Facial tracking is disabled by default, but if you enable it, it will remain “on” until you disable it. You can disable the feature at any time by adjusting your Platform settings.

How Does it Work?

Facial tracking features work by using video of your face to detect movements of your facial features. We analyze your facial features in real-time and animate your avatar so that its face reflects what your face is doing. Both you and other users will be able to see these avatar animations.

We do not use the video of your face or the analysis of your facial features to identify you. 

How Long is Facial Tracking Data Retained?

The video and analysis information related to your facial features is processed and retained on your device in temporary memory only as long as necessary to animate your avatar. After that, the video and analysis information is erased from memory. The analysis information created by this process is deleted in real-time after it has been used to animate your avatar and cannot be saved.

Who Can Access Facial Tracking Data?

The video and analysis information related to your facial features is not shared with VRChat or any third parties.
